In this project I created a very basic landing page of Lego with animated elements. The aim was to practice the Transform. Transition, and Animation properties of CSS to present a beautiful site of Lego Superheroes ‚≠ê.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Key Concepts

The following are the key CSS properties used within the project:

1. Grid Layout
2. Flexbox
3. Animation (animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, animation-timing-function, animation-fill-mode)
4. Transition
5. Transform (translate, rotate)
